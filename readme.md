#Snappy BigBoard Application
Implements the [BigBoard API] (https://bigboard.us/api) for use as a first-party Snappy Application.

[BigBoard] (https://bigboard.us/) is a service that aggregates point-in-time events from other web services (and your own custom events) into a visually pleasing dashboard, allowing you to see what's really happening.
